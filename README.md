simplecommit
============

Find easy bugs/issues for people to get involved in the Open Source software community.

### What is this?

People often ask me how they can get involved in Open Source software. One of the hard parts
is finding a project that has tickets explicitly set aside to get new people involved.

It turns out that a lot of projects do set aside easy tickets to get people invovled, but there are several thousands of projects out there. Often, these issues are labeled as `easy`, `low-hanging-fruit`, `starter-ticket` or something else that signifies new people should take these tickets. Some projects go so far as to assign a mentor to a starter ticket, so when somebody wants to fix the issue they will have somebody who knows the codebase, the style guide, and the general rules of how to get things committed into the project.

### How does it work?

SimpleCommit uses github webhooks to let projects publish ticket info to us for easy tickets. We then present a search interface for people to ask something like 'show me a simple python ticket'
